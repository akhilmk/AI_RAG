Python Programming Introduction
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. 
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. 
Python's extensive standard library and active community make it a popular choice for web development, data analysis, 
artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
Python's syntax is designed to be clear and straightforward, which makes it an excellent language for beginners.
Python supports dynamic typing, meaning that variable types are determined at runtime, allowing for flexibility in coding.
Python's extensive libraries and frameworks, such as Django for web development and Pandas for data analysis,
make it a powerful tool for developers across various domains.
