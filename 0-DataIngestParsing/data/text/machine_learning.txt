Machine Learning Overview
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make predictions based on data.
It involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.
Machine learning can be categorized into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and  reinforcement learning.
Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the input data is paired with the  correct output.
Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data, allowing the model to find patterns and relationships in the data without explicit instructions.
Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to make decisions by rewarding it for correct actions and penalizing it for incorrect actions.
Machine learning is widely used in various applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.
